The examples from my Community Day presentation on node. Some of the examples are borrowed from the "Introduction on Node.js" talk hosted at http://nodejs.org so credit where credit is due

To compile node.js on your Macintosh or Linix (*nix) machine do the following

   download and unpack http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.8.tar.gz
   open a terminal and cd into the folder
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
